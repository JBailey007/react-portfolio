                <p>Hi! My name is Jalen and I am a Student at the University of Utah.
                    I am learning how to code and create amazing programs using different coding languages. 
                    I enjoy spending time with my Fiance and playing video games. I also enjoy going outdoors
                    and exploring my home state of Utah in my 2008 Jeep Wrangler.
                <br></br>
                <br></br> 
                    I decided I wanted to become a developer because I have worked as a Scrum Master for almost 2 years now. 
                    Each of the developers that I have worked with have inspired me to go out of my comfort zone and learn
                    something new and exciting.
                </p>
